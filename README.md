# github-project
The 3 files that I have uploaded are part of the many assignments that I have worked on for my magd class.
## [audio and sound](https://github.com/Darktemplar33/github-project/blob/main/audio%20sound.zip)
This first file is what I had covered and learned while working to implement sound and audio into project.
## [drag kni](https://github.com/Darktemplar33/github-project/blob/main/drag%20kni.zip)
This project covered the basics of adding images and text into the web browser. I tried adding a cool quote with images that related to it.
## [pipes](https://github.com/Darktemplar33/github-project/blob/main/pipe.zip)
My final file cover the creation of the simple video game called flappy bird. Although it is just an image and not an actual game.
